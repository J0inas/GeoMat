# GeoMat
Geometric algorithms and other mathematical things displayed with [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).

## My Inspiration and Aspiration
This project is supposed to reflect my learnings in theoretical computerscience and math by visualising and explaining the things I learned in university.

The **goal** is to create meaningful visualizations for my fellow students, those to come and most of all: Myself. Because I probably am going to forget one topic eventually and need a little refresh from time to time.

## Where can I find the videos?
